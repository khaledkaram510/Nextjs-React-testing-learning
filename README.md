# 📘 Next.js Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal **Next.js learning repo** — a monorepo of hands-on projects where I explore the framework's features step-by-step.

Each folder inside this repo contains a self-contained Next.js project focused on a specific concept or feature.

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

I created this repo to:

- Learn Next.js in-depth through real examples
- Track my progress clearly, lesson by lesson
- Experiment with both the **App Router** and the **Pages Router**
- Keep everything organized and reusable
